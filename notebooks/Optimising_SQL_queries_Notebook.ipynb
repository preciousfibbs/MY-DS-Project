In addition, writing large SQL queries has the **potential to jam a server** (in a server-based configuration). For example, if a server spends too much time on a single query, other queries need to \"wait in line\" for the server to complete processing the one query. As a result, it is critical that we write more efficient queries, for example, queries that only read the data that is required."
